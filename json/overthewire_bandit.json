	<p>
	The Bandit wargame is aimed at absolute beginners. It will teach the basics needed to be able to play other wargames.
	</p>
	<p>
	This game, like most other games, is organised in levels. You start at Level 0 and try to \"beat\" or \"finish\" it. Finishing a level results in information on how to start the next level. The pages on this website for \"Level <X>\" contain information on how to start level X from the previous level. E.g. The page for Level 1 has information on how to gain access from Level 0 to Level 1.
	</p>
	<p>
	You will encounter many situations in which you have no idea what you are supposed to do. <b>Don't panic! Don't give up!</b> The purpose of this game is for you to learn the basics. Part of learning the basics, is reading a lot of new information.

	The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need to connect is <b>bandit.labs.overthewire.org</b>, on port <code>2220</code>. The username is <code>bandit0</code> and the password is <code>bandit0</code>. <br><br>

The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

    The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL encryption. <br>

    Helpful note: Getting \"HEARTBEATING\" and \"Read R BLOCK\"? Use -ign_eof and read the \"CONNECTED COMMANDS\" section in the manpage. Next to 'R' and 'Q', the 'B' command also works in this version of that command...

The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000.

There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it. <br>

To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.				",

    There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).
   	<br>
    NOTE: To beat this level, you need to login twice: once to run the setuid command, and once to start a network daemon to which the setuid will connect.
	<br>
    NOTE 2: Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it works as you think

    NOTE 2: Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy around...
