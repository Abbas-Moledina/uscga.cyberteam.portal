			<h3> Welcome back to the Cyber Team! </h3>
		</p>
		<p>
			This is a small set of challenges just to whet your appetite and get your head back in the game.
			Please, don't consider it a competition -- you're not in it to win anything or race to the top.
			The challenges here are meant to be simple, but still have enough quirks to remind you 'how to cyber'...
			you know, think critically and research tools and techniques, and hopefully write some code.
		</p>

		<h2>Good luck and have fun!</h2>
